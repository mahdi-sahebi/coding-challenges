# ANALYSIS 'a'

### 1. Execute
To get start, first of all let's execute the binary file normally and see the result.

```bach
cd ./deps
./a
```

Output:
```
 ./a 
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

Now we see the program crashes without any sign and the sitation is bad!, so we need a run-time analyser tools like **Valgrind** and also **GDB** is possible.
