# ANALYSIS 'b'
For debugging this file, we act like the file [analysis_a](analysis_a.md).

## 1. Execute
To get start, first of all let's execute the binary file normally and see the result.

```bach
cd ./deps
./b
```

Output:
```
./b
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

Now we see the program crashes, so we need a run-time analyser tools like **Valgrind** and also **GDB** is possible.

# 2. Valgrind Checking
To use Valgrind as analyser use command below with options:

Command:
```bash
valgrind --tool=memcheck --track-origins=yes ./b
```

Output:
```
 valgrind --tool=memcheck --track-origins=yes ./b
